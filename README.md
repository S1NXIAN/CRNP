One web application that runs **Crates N' Plates Diner** online and in-store: customers order food ahead or book rental items from their phones, cashiers run the counter and verify GCash payments, kitchen staff work from a live order display, and the owner manages the menu, inventory, staff accounts, business settings, and sales reports — all from a browser, on any device.

There is nothing to install for end users. Everyone uses the same responsive web app through a link.

¹ Cashier/Kitchen history pages are read-only archives of their own workflow.

Access is enforced per page by role guards (`includes/auth.php`). Each role uses its own session cookie (`SESS_USER`, `SESS_CASHIER`, `SESS_KITCHEN`, `SESS_ADMIN`), so different roles can be signed in side-by-side in one browser.

## Technology

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Server-rendered PHP pages, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, mobile-first |
| Backend | PHP 8.2 (procedural pages + lightweight OOP models) |
| Database | Firebase Realtime Database via its REST API (`firebaseRDB.php`) |
| Auth | Email + password with OTP verification, optional Google Sign-In, bcrypt hashing |
| Email | PHPMailer over Gmail SMTP (STARTTLS, port 587) |
| Hosting | Render (Docker runtime, `php:8.2-apache`) |

No build step, no separate API server: PHP serves both the UI and the data layer, which talks to Firebase over REST. A file-based cache keeps dashboard reads fast.

## Deploying to Render

The repository ships with two files that make deployment nearly automatic:

- **`render.yaml`** — Render Blueprint describing the web service (free plan, health checks, environment variables)
- **`Dockerfile`** — packages the PHP app with Apache

> **Note (free plan).** The free instance sleeps after ~15 minutes idle; the first visitor after a lull waits about a minute. Uploaded images (avatars, GCash proofs) are stored on the instance's ephemeral disk and are lost on every redeploy/restart. Upgrade the service plan and attach a disk mounted at `/var/www/html/uploads` when the restaurant goes live for real.

### Step-by-step

1. **Push this repository to GitHub.**

2. **Create the Blueprint.** Render Dashboard → **New → Blueprint** → select the repo → **Apply**. Render reads `render.yaml` and prompts for the secret variables marked `sync: false`.

3. **Fill in the environment variables** when prompted (values explained in [Configuration Reference](#configuration-reference)):
   - `FIREBASE_URL` — copy **verbatim** from Firebase Console → Realtime Database (see the regional-URL warning below)
   - `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASS` — Gmail address and a 16-character App Password ([create one here](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords); requires 2-Step Verification)
   - `MAIL_FROM` — optional; defaults to `SMTP_USER`
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` — optional OAuth client ID enabling customer Google sign-in
   - `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` — full contents of a Firebase service-account JSON key (steps below)

4. **Create the Firebase service-account key** (one time):
   - Firebase Console → ⚙️ **Project settings** → **Service accounts**
   - **Generate new private key** → a JSON file downloads
   - Open it, copy *everything* (including the outer `{ }`), paste into Render's `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS`

5. **Add your Render URL to Google sign-in** (only if using Google login):
   - [Google Cloud Console → Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) → open the OAuth 2.0 Client ID
   - Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, add `https://YOUR-SERVICE.onrender.com` (no trailing slash)

6. **Lock down the database.** Firebase Console → **Realtime Database → Rules** → replace with the contents of `database.rules.json` (auth-locked rules plus the `.indexOn` entries every list page queries with `orderBy`).
   Publish **after** step 4 is complete, otherwise the server loses database access. Keep the file and the Console copy in sync — adding a new `Model::where()` field means adding its `.indexOn` here too.

> **Regional URL warning.** Databases created outside US-central live on a `*.firebasedatabase.app` domain. Always copy the URL shown above your data tree in Firebase Console — pointing at a `.firebaseio.com` address makes every request fail with *"Database lives in a different region."*

## First-Run Setup

After the first successful deploy:

1. Open `https://YOUR-SERVICE.onrender.com/admin/signup.php` and create the first administrator.
   The page disables itself once an admin exists — then **delete `admin/signup.php` from the server/repo** as good practice.
2. Sign in as admin → **Staff** → create cashier and kitchen accounts.
3. **Settings** → fill in business info, opening hours, GCash number and QR image.
4. **Products / Rent Items** → populate the menu and rental inventory.
5. Customer self-service: `/user/signup.php` (email + OTP verification) or Google sign-in if configured.

## Configuration Reference

All configuration is environment-based — nothing sensitive is stored in code.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|:---:|---|
| `FIREBASE_URL` | yes | Realtime Database URL, copied verbatim from Firebase Console. Regional databases use `*.firebasedatabase.app`. |
| `SMTP_USER` | yes | Gmail account that sends OTP, order, and receipt emails |
| `SMTP_PASS` | yes | 16-character Gmail App Password (never the login password) |
| `MAIL_FROM` | no | Outgoing "from" address; defaults to `SMTP_USER` |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | no | OAuth client ID; when set, the customer login page shows a Google button |
| `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` | prod | Full service-account JSON key. Signs every database request; required once rules require `auth != null`. Treat as a root secret. |
| `DEV_MODE` | no | `1` shows OTPs on screen when SMTP is down. Development only — never enable in production. |

On Render these live in the service's **Environment** tab. For local development they go in a `.env` file at the project root (git-ignored). Note: `.env` values are parsed line-by-line, so keep the `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` JSON on a single line locally.

## Local Development

Requirements: PHP 8.0+ with `curl` and `fileinfo` extensions, Apache (e.g. XAMPP), a Firebase project, a Gmail account.

1. Point Apache's DocumentRoot **at this folder** — internal links assume the app is served from `/`.
2. Create `.env` from the template (`cp .env.example .env`) and fill in real values:
   ```ini
   FIREBASE_URL="https://your-db-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app"
   SMTP_USER="your@gmail.com"
   SMTP_PASS="16-char-app-password"
   MAIL_FROM="your@gmail.com"
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=""
   DEV_MODE="0"
   ```
3. Start Apache and open the site. No build step, no migrations.

## Maintenance & Security

| Cadence | Task | How |
|---|---|---|
| Immediately if leaked | Rotate any exposed credential | Gmail App Passwords page or Firebase Console → Service accounts → Keys → delete old, create new, update Render env var |
| Quarterly | Rotate Gmail App Password | Same procedure; update `SMTP_PASS` on Render |
| Quarterly | Rotate service-account key | Delete old key in Firebase Console → generate new → update `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` on Render |
| Weekly | Back up data | Firebase Console → Realtime Database → ⋮ → **Export JSON**; store off-site |
| After each deploy | Refresh any open tabs | Deployments reset sessions; stale pages show *"Security token expired"* until reloaded |

Security posture already built in: bcrypt password hashing, per-session CSRF tokens on every form, rate-limited logins, hardened session cookies (secure flags auto-enable under HTTPS), security headers on every response, database access locked behind service-account authentication, and uploads directory hardened against script execution.

Known limitation of the free plan: uploaded files are ephemeral (see note under [Deploying to Render](#deploying-to-render)).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| *"Database lives in a different region"* in logs; logins fail | `FIREBASE_URL` uses `.firebaseio.com` but DB is regional | Copy exact URL from Firebase Console → Realtime Database |
| *"Access blocked: Authorization Error"* on Google sign-in | Render URL missing from OAuth client origins | Add `https://…onrender.com` under Authorized JavaScript origins, wait ~5 min |
| *"Could not sign you in with Google"* repeatedly | Server-side database write failed | Render Logs → search `[firebaseRDB]`; usually credentials or rules mismatch |
| *"Security token expired"* after submitting a form | Page was open across a redeploy; session reset | Reload the page and retry |
| Site slow on first visit after a quiet period | Free instance woke from spin-down | Expected on free plan; upgrade plan to remove |
| OTP email not arriving | Wrong/rotated App Password | Verify `SMTP_PASS`; check spam folder |

For anything else, check **Render → Logs** first: database errors are logged with a `[firebaseRDB]` prefix describing the exact cause.
